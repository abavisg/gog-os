# Incremental Implementation Plan

## Rule

Build one module at a time. No dashboard. No write-back until read-only workflows are proven.

---

## DONE

### Phase A — FoundationOS
- `gogos/paths.py` — dated storage path resolver.
- `gogos/system/setup_check.py` — validates Python ≥3.11, required dirs, optional creds.
- `/setup-check` command wired to script.
- Tests passing.

### Phase A.5 — Google Auth
- `gogos/auth/google_auth.py` — OAuth helper, per-account tokens at `chmod 600`.
- `/login-google [account]` and `/logout-google [account]` with confirmation.
- Multi-account (`personal`, `work`) supported from the start.
- Tests passing.

### Phase B — EmailOS (read-only)
- `gogos/gmail/gmail_fetch.py` — metadata-only fetch, hard-asserts no body in output.
- `gogos/gmail/gmail_normalise.py` — raw → canonical slim JSON, UTC dates.
- `gogos/gmail/gmail_triage.py` — validates and writes triage JSON.
- `gogos/gmail/gmail_report.py` — Markdown + HTML report, auto-opens in Chrome.
- `email-triage` skill hardened against prompt injection.
- `/email-report [account]` end-to-end working.
- Tests passing.

### Phase B.5 — EmailOS write-back (move to GSD folders)
- OAuth scope bumped `gmail.readonly` → `gmail.modify` (label + archive, never delete).
- `gogos/gmail/gmail_apply.py` — builds a move plan from latest triage, applies on approval.
  Move = add `GSD/<Category>` label + remove `INBOX` (archive). Never trashes/deletes/spams;
  enforced by a single gated `_modify` and `_assert_safe`.
- Two-step approval: proposal written to `.core/storage/approvals/<account>/<date>/gmail-labels.json`
  with `approved: false`; applied only after explicit user confirmation.
- Missing `GSD/*` label → abort with a clear message (no auto-create, no partial apply).
- Stale-email warning surfaces inbox mail predating yesterday 00:00.
- `/email-apply [account]` command wired end-to-end.
- Tests passing (260/260), including the never-delete invariant.

### Phase 4 — CalendarOS (read-only)
- `gogos/calendar/calendar_fetch.py` — events for today/tomorrow/week, safe projection (no descriptions).
- `gogos/calendar/calendar_normalise.py` — raw → slim JSON, UTC dates, duration, all-day flag.
- `gogos/calendar/calendar_report.py` — Markdown + HTML brief, auto-opens in Chrome.
- `calendar-brief` skill — focus gaps, risks, per-event prep notes, injection-hardened.
- `/calendar-brief [account] [today|tomorrow|week]` end-to-end working.
- Tests passing (199/199).

### Phase 4.5 — EmailOS automation (unattended triage + batch drain)
- `gogos/gmail/gmail_classify.py` — deterministic, ordered first-match-wins classifier
  (normalised slim JSON → triage JSON, same schema `gmail_triage` validates). Runs with
  no human in the loop. Sender lists in `.core/config/gmail/classify.json` so they grow
  without code changes. Never-delete invariant (financial/security/civic/real-person
  never land in Safe to Delete) enforced by rule order and tested.
- `gogos/gmail/gmail_loop.py` + `/email-loop [account] [--yes]` — drains an inbox larger
  than the fetch cap by looping fetch→normalise→classify→triage→report→apply in batches
  until the inbox is empty. Bounded (max 20 iterations). `--yes` pre-authorises all
  batches; default pauses for approval per batch. Still never deletes.
- `docs/EMAILOS_AUTOMATION.md` — locked decisions: scheduled run stays read-only
  (fetch→classify→report→notify), moves remain manual via `/email-apply` / `/email-loop`.
- `docs/CONNECTOR_CONTRACT.md` — the `fetch(client, window)` / `normalise(raw)` seam every
  connector conforms to, ahead of extracting connectors into a separate repo.
- Scheduling deferred: a cloud routine can't run the local pipeline (no venv/OAuth/storage);
  a local launchd/cron job is the path when we automate.
- Tests passing (289/289).

### Phase 4.6 — EmailOS finalisation

Close out EmailOS: make unattended runs safe and reversible, add user-controlled rules,
merge accounts, and give it a single morning entry point. Everything here stays inside
the existing privacy/approval gates (metadata-only, moves via label+archive, never delete).

**1. Undo / reverse a batch (`/email-undo`).**
- Every `apply` writes an **inverse plan** to `.core/storage/approvals/<account>/<date>/undo.json`
  alongside the move plan: for each moved message, the exact reversal (remove `GSD/<Category>`,
  restore `INBOX`).
- `/email-undo [account]` replays the latest `undo.json` through the same gated `_modify`,
  so undo is as safe as apply and never deletes. Makes unattended/scheduled moves reversible.

**2. User classification rules (override, safety-capped).**
- New config `.core/config/gmail/rules.json`: ordered user rules, each `{match, category}`
  where `match` targets sender domain / substring / pattern (e.g. `LinkedIn Jobs → GSD/Review`).
- User rules are checked **first** and win over built-in rules — **except** they can never
  route a financial/security/civic/real-person mail into `Safe to Delete`; the never-delete
  invariant stays absolute (a user rule that tries is refused, logged, and falls through).
- No new folders/labels — reuse the existing `GSD/Review` (read-then-delete/archive) and the
  current category set. Review is the holding pen; low-confidence built-in matches route there
  rather than to a destructive-ish category.

**3. Sender-consistency ledger (enforce + learn).**
- A local ledger `.core/storage/gmail/<account>/sender-ledger.json` records `sender → category`
  decisions. Same sender always classifies the same way within and across runs.
- Config or user-rule changes update the ledger (explicit re-learn), never a silent drift.
- Test asserts no sender splits two ways in a run; runtime asserts a new decision matches the
  ledger or updates it deliberately.

**4. Digest header on the report.**
- Add a 3-line executive summary at the top of the email report: counts by category with the
  important call-outs (e.g. "4 Action (2 financial), 1 Event needs RSVP, 62 Safe-to-Delete
  queued"). Designed to grow as Calendar/Task digests join it in `/start-day`.

**5. Multi-account merge (personal + work).**
- `/start-day` (and the email report) can run **both** accounts and present **one merged
  panel, each item account-tagged** `[personal]` / `[work]`. Fetch/classify/apply still run
  per-account under the hood; only the view is unified. Undo and approval remain per-account.

**6. `/start-day` orchestrator + SessionStart hook.**
- `/start-day` is the single morning command: runs EmailOS **read-only** (fetch → classify →
  triage → report) across accounts, prints the merged digest panel, and **stops**. No moves —
  write-back stays behind `/email-apply` / `/email-loop`.
- A SessionStart **hook** *offers* it ("Run /start-day? 12 new, 3 need action") — it nudges,
  never auto-runs write-back, preserving local-first + approval principles.
- Later, `/start-day` folds in CalendarOS and TaskOS digests (Phases 5–6).

**7. Local scheduler (unparks the morning run).**
- A local **launchd/cron** job runs the real `gogos` pipeline (has venv, OAuth token, storage)
  at ~08:00: fetch → classify → triage → report → **notify**, read-only. Fires only while the
  Mac is on. Moves stay manual. (Cloud routines remain out — they can't run the local pipeline.)

**8. Reconciliation loop + unsubscribe surfacing.**

The key insight: the classifier is currently fire-and-forget — it never learns when you
overrule it by dragging a message elsewhere. That same manual-correction signal is what makes
unsubscribe *trustworthy* (a sender you never rescue is safe to kill) AND what fixes
misclassification (a sender you keep rescuing should be re-learned, never unsubscribed).
So reconciliation is the foundation; unsubscribe and auto-learn are consumers of it. Staged
so nothing is blocked and each stage ships independently:

- **v1a — Capture (ships immediately, zero risk).** Add `List-Unsubscribe` and
  `List-Unsubscribe-Post` to `_METADATA_HEADERS` in `gmail_fetch.py` and to the normalised
  record in `gmail_normalise.py` (new `unsubscribe` field). These are headers, not body — they
  pass the existing privacy gate unchanged (no body ever reaches storage). Data starts
  accumulating so later stages have history.
- **v1b — Reconcile.** On each fetch, compare a message's *current* Gmail labels against where
  the classifier filed it last run (recorded at apply time). The delta = your manual move.
  Pure metadata (label sets only), fully within the privacy gate. Produces per-sender
  correction counts.
- **v1c — Learn (auto, logged, reversible).** After N corrections for a sender, **auto-update
  the sender ledger** to your corrected category; the classifier follows next run. This changes
  classifier behaviour without an explicit approval — acceptable because it only ever moves
  *labels* (never deletes) and both `/email-undo` and manual drag remain. Each auto-learn is
  **logged as a "learned rule" line in the report** and easily reverted, so it is never a silent
  black box. (This is the mechanism the sender-consistency ledger in §3 learns from.)
- **v1d — Surface unsubscribe.** Candidate = a sender carrying `List-Unsubscribe` that you
  **never rescue** from `Safe to Delete` / `Newsletters` (per reconciliation). The report/panel
  shows the unsubscribe link or `mailto:`; **you click it yourself** — zero write-back, no new
  gate, no new OAuth scope. Senders you *do* rescue are excluded (they get re-learned instead).

**Parked (unsubscribe v2):** gated one-click unsubscribe (`/email-unsubscribe` performing the
`mailto:` send or RFC 8058 `List-Unsubscribe-Post`) — a genuine outbound action that crosses the
approval gate and needs a send scope. Named, not scheduled.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `/email-undo` fully reverses the latest batch; a test proves apply→undo is a no-op on labels.
- User rules override built-ins but a test proves they can't push an important mail to Safe to Delete.
- Sender-ledger test proves no sender classifies two ways in a run.
- Digest header renders correct counts; merged panel account-tags every item.
- `/start-day` runs read-only across accounts and never moves; the hook only offers, never acts.
- Scheduler documented and installable; the scheduled run is provably read-only.
- `List-Unsubscribe` capture: a test proves the header reaches the normalised record and no body
  ever passes the privacy gate as a result.
- Reconciliation: a test proves a message moved (labels changed) since apply is detected as a
  correction and attributed to its sender.
- Auto-learn: after N corrections a test proves the ledger updates to the corrected category and
  the change is logged (and revertible); it never routes an important mail to Safe to Delete.
- Unsubscribe surfacing: a sender you rescue is excluded from candidates; one you never rescue is
  surfaced. No write-back occurs.

**Parked (EmailOS v2 backlog — named, not scheduled):** VIP / waiting-on detection; snooze/defer
a thread (TaskOS overlap); weekly email review feeding ReflectionOS; low-confidence "Needs-Review"
as a distinct signal beyond reusing `GSD/Review`.

### Phase 5 — TaskOS Local MVP

Local-first task store: no external service, no write-back gate needed (all data is
local). Follows the module shape — `add` / `list` / `update` functions + `__main__` CLI,
each tested — and the storage convention (dated file **and** a `latest-*` alias).

Modules:
- `gogos/tasks/task_store.py` — the store. A task is `{id, title, status, created_utc,
  updated_utc, due, tags, history[]}`; status ∈ `open | done | dropped`. Append-safe
  creation (new task never rewrites existing ones); every status change appends to
  `history[]` with a UTC timestamp rather than overwriting — status updates preserve
  history. Tasks persist to `.core/storage/tasks/<account-or-local>/tasks.jsonl`
  (append-only) with a derived `latest-open.json` slim projection for consumers.
- `gogos/tasks/task_report.py` — renders today's / open tasks to Markdown (mirrors the
  existing `*_report.py` shape). No skill needed for the MVP — deterministic listing.

Commands:
- `/task-add <title> [--due YYYY-MM-DD] [--tag ...]` — append a new open task.
- `/tasks-today` — list open tasks (due today or overdue first, then undated).
- `/task-done <id>` — mark done; appends to history, refreshes `latest-open.json`.

Acceptance criteria:
- Append-safe creation, status updates preserve history (nothing is ever rewritten in
  place; `history[]` is the audit trail).
- `latest-open.json` slim projection stays current after every mutation, so the morning
  brief (Phase 6) can read open tasks without parsing the full JSONL.
- Timestamps stored UTC, rendered local at report time (per storage conventions).
- Tests under `tests/test_tasks_*.py` cover: append-only creation, history preservation
  on `done`/`dropped`, and the `latest-open.json` projection.

### Phase 6 — BriefingOS MVP

Build `/morning-brief` aggregating latest EmailOS, CalendarOS, and TaskOS outputs.

Acceptance criteria:
- One useful brief with priorities, schedule, email actions, risks.
- Missing modules handled gracefully.
- Cites source artefacts.

### Phase 7 — ActivityOS MVP

Build `/log [type] [text]` writing to dated JSONL. Types: activity, decision, learning, workout, content, note.

Acceptance criteria:
- Append-only. Timestamped. Consumable by ReflectionOS.

### Phase 8 — ReflectionOS MVP

Build `/end-day` and `/weekly-review` reading daily logs and morning brief.

Acceptance criteria:
- Completed / slipped / decisions / follow-ups / tomorrow seed list.

### Phase 9 — NewsOS MVP

Build `/news-brief [feed]` from configured feeds. Manual source first, automated later.

Acceptance criteria:
- Source-linked, relevance-scored, low volume.

## LATER

Phases 10–11 (LearningOS, HealthOS, ContentOS Bridge) only after the Morning Brief and Reflection loops have been running usefully for at least two weeks.

Phase 12 (Dashboard) only if the command-line loop proves insufficient.
